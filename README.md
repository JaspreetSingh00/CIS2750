# CIS 2750
Software Systems Development and Integration

In this course, we were asked to develop a software from beginning to end. Throughout the duration of the course, each assingment focused on different aspects of software development. Assingments one and two focused on the backend and required us to create an SVG image parser in C that parsed through any given .svg file and extracted information pertaining to the image. Assignment three allowed us to develop a webpage that illustrated our code.
